# Unit 1

Unit 1 is all about showing the humble beginnings of the web and introducing students to foundational programming concepts that we'll use for the entire rest of the course.

Since our pre-work a large portion of our curriculum practices programming concepts in JavaScript, in this unit, we review data types, functions, and other foundational concepts in JavaScript.
