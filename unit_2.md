"Learning is hard work, but everything
you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier." - Author of Eloquent Javascript

This unit starts with Sinatra and later, focuses on Rails. By starting with Sinatra, and slowly building up to the processes and file/folder structure used by Rails, we are able to scaffold the learning experience without overwhelming students, at first, with the Rails file structure. We try to build an understanding of the reasons that Rails arrived on the scene. We generally don't get to APIs in this unit because there are enough foundational topics to cover in OOP, MVC, data modeling, and more. This is where students get to build their first real set of full-stack applications.
