# Unit 3

Braindead Pancakes, congratulation on reaching the Third Unit. Unit 3 is all about APIs. We want you to be able to use them and create them, with both Ruby and JavaScript frameworks. Because you've just spent so much time with Rails, we'll start with APIs in Rails, enough to give you a solid foundation for the rest of the unit.

This unit is where you'll learn Node, via Express & MongoDB. Since MongoDB goes well with Express, it gives us a chance to teach you about an alternative to SQL databases that are relevant to the industry; and since you're building APIs, you'll have to consume them. 

Throughout the unit, you won't have an understanding of any front-end frameworks, partially because until recently, these frameworks haven't really become necessary. You'll learn them in the next unit, once you feel the pain of AJAX and templating the old-fashioned way and crave something more organized. 

:) Cheerios!
