# API Hackathon
## Introduction
We've spent some time building our own APIs, and now, itâ€™s time to explore third-party APIs in this mini hackathon!
You are welcome to use any API you'd like - look below for some suggestions.
You will compete for `Coolest Project Award`, given to whichever team builds the most useful, interesting, and fun app.
## Exercise
#### Requirements
- Build a Sinatra, Rails, or even a command line app that implements at least one API
## Additional Resources
